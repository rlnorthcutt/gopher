# IMPORTANT: If you need to install Go dependencies or perform other setup
# that relies on the base image being fully set up, do it AFTER installing
# the CLIs.  This ensures the CLIs are available when those commands run.
# Example:
# COPY go.mod go.sum ./
# RUN go mod download

# You likely already have this in your Dockerfile, but it's crucial
# to keep it after the CLI installations if it was previously there.
# COPY . /workspace  # Or whatever your copy command is

# If you need to set a working directory, do it after the installation
# and any dependency installation.
# WORKDIR /workspace

# If you have a CMD instruction, it should also be at the end.
# CMD ["your", "command"]
